# DESPOT Tutorials

![](images/gazebo_screenshot.png)

An example of using [DESPOT](https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/despot) with real-robots via ROS. We present a slightly modified version of the Laser Tag problem: a robot chases a target by using noisy laser-sensors to observe its environment. When the robot is adjacent to the target, it calls 'Tag' to terminate a successful pursuit. The simulation consists of two holonomic robots ([KUKA Youbot](http://www.youbot-store.com/)) inside a [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) environment resembling the problem world described in DESPOT paper (Page 20) [1].

## Requirements

Tested Operating Systems:

| Ubuntu 14.04     
| :-------------: 
|[![Build Status](https://semaphoreapp.com/api/v1/projects/d4cca506-99be-44d2-b19e-176f36ec8cf1/128505/shields_badge.svg)](https://semaphoreapp.com/boennemann/badges)    

Dependencies: DESPOT, ROS Indigo+, Boost 1.55+, Gazebo 2+

## Prerequisites

Install [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu).
We recommend the `ros-indigo-desktop-full` version which includes Gazebo.  

Install the latest DESPOT using [CMakeLists](https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/despot#cmakelists). Make sure that DESPOT binaries and header files are installed.
```bash
$ cd <latest_despot_repo>
$ mkdir build; cd build

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../ 
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Install BOOST libraries with `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev` 

## Installation

If you haven't sourced your ROS environment, run:
```bash
$ source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash OR <existing_workspace>/devel/setup.bash
```

Setup a fresh catkin workspace for **despot_tutorials**:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/despot_ws/src
$ cd ~/despot_ws/
$ catkin_make 
$ source devel/setup.bash
```

Clone the repository:
```bash
$ cd ~/despot_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/despot_tutorials.git
```

Compile:
```bash
cd ~/despot_ws
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

## Usage

Launch the Gazebo environment and robot controllers:
```bash
$ roslaunch laser_tag laser_tag.launch R1_noise:=0.5
```

On a separate terminal, run the POMDP planner:
```bash
$ rosrun laser_tag pomdp_planner
```

You should see a 3D 7x11 grid world with two Youbots. The green robot should chase the red robot until 'Tag' is called. The `R1_noise` parameter specifies the gaussian noise (standard deviation in meters) of the green robot's laser range finder.  

## Guidelines

In general, to use DESPOT with real-world systems: 
1. Setup an interface to communacate with your systems by inheriting the `World` abstract class. (See class `LaserTagWorld` in [main.cpp](examples/laser_tag/src/pomdp_planner/main.cpp)).
    * Implement the `Connect` and `Initialize` functions in `World` to estabilish connection with your system and        intitialize it if possible.
    * Implement the `ExecuteAction` function in `World` to send actions to your system and receive observations from it in the format specified in your POMDP model (e.g: `ACT_TYPE` & `OBS_TYPE` parameters).
2. Initialize your planner by inheirting the `Planner` class. (See class `MyPlanner` in [main.cpp](examples/laser_tag/src/pomdp_planner/main.cpp)).
    * Provide the planner your POMDP model and custom world by implementing the `InitializeModel` ans `InitializeWorld` functions.
    * Choose "DESPOT" to be the solver by implementing `ChooseSolver`, and setup default parameters, such as number of scenarios, search time per step, etc., by implementing `InitializeDefaultParameters`.
3. Launch the planning pipeline in your main function by calling the `runPlanning` function in `Planner`. (See the main function in [main.cpp](examples/laser_tag/src/pomdp_planner/main.cpp)).
